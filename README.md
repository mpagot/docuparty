# docuparty
Repository to experiment with various documentation tech

## Ideas to try
List of something that I like to give a try:

* githubactions to spellcheck and Markdown lint
* Publish documentation in READDOC or GitHub project page
* Releases

## Text to check

Try the `.wordlist.txt` to ignore some words like canocie and granzi.
